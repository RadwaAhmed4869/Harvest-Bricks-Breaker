Ball: There is a ball that bounces off the paddle and the walls.

Scoring: You earn points for harvesting vegetables (bricks). The point value of each brick may vary, and some bricks may release postions (power-ups) when destroyed.

Potions(Power-Ups): Power-ups can be collected as they fall from broken bricks during gameplay. These power-ups have various effects, such as making the paddle larger, spawning another ball, or giving extra live.

Lives: You are given a set number of lives, and you lose a life when the ball falls off the screen. The game ends when you run out of lives.
