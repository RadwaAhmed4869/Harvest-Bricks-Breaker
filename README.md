Paddle: Using the mouse, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen. The paddle is used to bounce a ball and prevent it from falling off the screen.

Ball: There is a ball that bounces off the paddle and the walls.

Scoring: You earn points for harvesting vegetables (bricks). The point value of each brick may vary, and some bricks may release postions (power-ups) when destroyed.

Potions(Power-Ups): Power-ups can be collected as they fall from broken bricks during gameplay. These power-ups have various effects, such as making the paddle larger, spawning another ball, or giving extra live.

Levels: The game is divided into levels, each with a unique arrangement of bricks. As you progress through the levels, the game becomes more challenging with more complex brick patterns.

Lives: You are given a set number of lives, and you lose a life when the ball falls off the screen. The game ends when you run out of lives.

Sound and Graphics: The game features particles system and sound effects.
